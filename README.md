- 👻 I’m a software engineer who also has great interest in cyber security and ethical hacking. I enjoy systems programming and web programming and a bit of artificial intelligence.  
- 😈 I'm interested in building hacker tools, writing exploits, and reverse engineering. Check out my cyber sec blog at exitvillain.com. I have a great into 
     to assembly code and the call stack on there. 
- 🔒 Let's be honest some of my projects here are just for show. I want to demonstrate to future employers some more advanced programs I have written, such as
  my assignments from the harvard artificial intelligence class, cs50AI and ShardMaster, one of my assignments from Distributed Systems from grad school. I think the two programs that actually ARE usefull are the simple ones. If you like 
  to read and look up words while you read, try wordsmith! Also,if you want to know your musical keys as well as you know your times tables up to 
  12, check out musician multiplcation!

- 😈 I'm interested in building hacker tools, writing exploits, and reverse engineering
- 🤖 I also enjoy systems programming and writing web applications. After all To attack a system,
     you should a bit of experience building them, in my opinion.
