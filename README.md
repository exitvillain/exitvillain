-- I’m a software engineer with a strong interest in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, systems programming, web development, and artificial intelligence.

-- For prospective employers, I’d be happy to share advanced projects, including assignments from Harvard's CS50AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ShardMaster, a distributed systems project from my graduate studies.

-- Want to see my work in action? Visit [**exitvillain.com**](https://exitvillain.com), a cybersecurity social media platform I designed and built using Django. It’s hosted on AWS, containerized with Docker, and includes an educational section on assembly code and the call stack.

-- I also created [**GothamSonic.com**](https://gothamsonic.com), a music discovery platform for NYC’s underground scene. It features a custom-built [React music player](https://github.com/exitvillain/gothamsonic-player) with adaptive bitrate streaming, playlist support, infinite scroll, and a real-time like-based ranking system — all running live in production.

-- Check out Wordsmith, a vocabulary journal builder powered by a dictionary API. It’s simple yet practical, perfect for avid readers!

- 👻⠀Hi! I'm @exitvillain
- 🧑🏻‍💻 I’m a cyber security engineer , ethical hacker, and software developer
     who wants to write his own exploits instead of running someone else's 
- 😈 I'm interested in building hacker tools, writing exploits, and reverse engineering
- 🤖 I also enjoy systems programming and writing web applications. After all To attack a system,
     you should a bit of experience building them, in my opinion.
- 🔒 You might find a few miscelaneous projects posted here as well
