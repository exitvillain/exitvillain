- 👻 I’m a software engineer who also has great interest in cyber security and ethical hacking. I enjoy systems programming and web programming and a bit of artificial intelligence.  
- 😈 I'm interested in building hacker tools, writing exploits, and reverse engineering. 
- 🔒 If you're a prospective employer, I would be happy to share some of my more advanced projects, including assignments from Harvard's CS50AI (Artificial Intelligence) course and ShardMaster, a distributed systems project from my graduate studies.
- 🤖 I think the programs here that you might want to actually use are the simple ones. If you like 
  to read and look up words while you read, try wordsmith! Also,if you want to know your musical keys as well as you know your times tables up to 
  12, check out musician multiplcation.
- 🧑🏻‍💻  Want to see some of my code in action? Visit exitvillain.com, a cybersecurity social media platform I designed and built using Django. I’m hosting it myself on AWS, containerized with Docker. There's also a great intro to assembly code and the call stack available there.

- 😈 I'm interested in building hacker tools, writing exploits, and reverse engineering
- 🤖 I also enjoy systems programming and writing web applications. After all To attack a system,
     you should a bit of experience building them, in my opinion.
