👻 I’m a software engineer with a strong interest in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, systems programming, web development, and artificial intelligence.

🔒 For prospective employers, I’d be happy to share advanced projects, including assignments from Harvard's CS50AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ShardMaster, a distributed systems project from my graduate studies.

🧑🏻‍💻 Want to see my work in action? Visit [**exitvillain.com**](https://exitvillain.com),, a cybersecurity social media platform I designed and built using Django. It’s hosted on AWS, containerized with Docker, and includes an educational section on assembly code and the call stack.

🤖 Check out Wordsmith, a vocabulary journal builder powered by a dictionary API. It’s simple yet practical, perfect for avid readers!
